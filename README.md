## Overview

This project includes implementations for several fundamental data structures. Each data structure is implemented in its own Python file, and the code is designed to be easily understandable and modifiable.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are included in this repository:

- **Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue** 
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **Hash Table**
Each implementation includes basic operations and methods commonly associated with the data structure.

## Usage

You can go ahead and run the provided Python files directly to see examples of how each data structure works. Each file contains an example code demonstrating the use of the data structure.

Feel free to modify the files and add your own tests to understand better how the data structures work.
